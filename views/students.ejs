        <p class="long-text">Keep pushing forward, dear students, for every challenge you face today is molding you into 
            the resilient, capable individual you're destined to become. Embrace each stumble as a stepping
             stone, each setback as a setup for a remarkable comeback. Your journey is not defined by the obstacles
              you encounter but by the strength and perseverance you exhibit in overcoming them. Believe in your abilities,
               stay focused on your goals, and let your passion fuel your drive towards success. Remember, greatness lies
                within you, waiting to be unleashed through dedication and hard work. So, rise above the doubts, defy the odds,
                 and let your determination illuminate the path to your dreams. You've got this!
